### :man_technologist: CRYPTO APP

---
  - This script provides a command-line interface for accessing the Coinbase API to retrieve cryptocurrency prices. 
It allows the user to display all available pairs, check the price of a currency pair at the current time or on a specified date and time, and compare the purchase price of a currency pair to the current valuation. The prices are displayed in a tabular format using the tabulate module.
